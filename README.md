# SAIS Genius Bar

The SAIS Genius Bar's mission is to assist others in the school acquire new skills to use the technology provided by the school more efficiently. In addition, we hope to teach the student and faculty throughout the school better methods to manage their devices.

We currently have four teams running: the Creative Content team, the Social Media team, the Logistics team, and the Projects and Collaborations team. Additionally, there is a team chair for each committee, and the chairs meet up every week. They, along with the chairperson, the general secretary, and the Genius Bar manager, form the Genius Bar Council.
